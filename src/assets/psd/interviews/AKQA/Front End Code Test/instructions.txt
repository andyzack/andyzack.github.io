## Code Test Instruction

The challenge is to convert code-test.psd into HTML. Our recommendation is to not spend too much time trying to get it perfect, but demonstrate your skills through well structured code and industry standard conventions. This means code formatting, comments and readable variable names. This will be our primary assessment focus. 

Included is the data file (as well as a hosted version), images and PSD.

Requirements:
• Build with MV* framework 
• Read data from JSON using https://api.jsonbin.io/b/5cae9a54fb42337645ebcad3
• Responsive Layout
• Build dropdown filters from data
• Hide and show data depending on the dropdown filters

Don't forget:
- The page should be responsive and that it displays elegantly on mobile through to desktop.
- Create a Github or Bitbucket repository and commit your work to this repository (please refrain from including AKQA in the repository name).
- Include a Readme of how to use your repository.

We encourage you not to use pre-made HTML boilerplates, and to only use what is needed for this task. We want to see what you can do.

When completed, please send your Github or Bitbucket repository to us for review to lindsay.lim@akqa.com.
